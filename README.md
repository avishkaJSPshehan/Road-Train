# Road-Train
Project Road Train

Road Train is one of the most common modes of freight transportation in Australia. Here, a prime mover truck is involved in long-distance transportation involving more than one Taylor. This is easy in that country because the direct highways are used. Therefore, a large amount of goods can be transported easily and at a low cost.

The aim of this project is to adapt this method in practice to Sri Lanka, where Vangu is widely seen considering Sri Lanka's topography and roads. Therefore, in this project, we will try to introduce a new steering system for these types of vehicles.

To simulate this, we use ESP32 bords and arduino. The road and the vehicle are set at a ratio of 1:20.
